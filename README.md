Project Description for GitHub README
Vibezlife AI - Real Estate Data Analysis AI Powered by Bun.js
Vibezlife is an AI-powered backend application designed to process and analyze real estate databases. This project utilizes Bun.js for server-side operations, PostgreSQL for data storage, and OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating data-driven investment suggestions. The system is capable of handling user input, summarizing real estate data, and providing insightful analysis and recommendations for real estate investments.

Features
Data Ingestion:

Upload and manage property data.
Fetch and summarize property data from PostgreSQL.
AI-Powered Analysis:

Generate investment suggestions based on real estate data.
Provide personalized recommendations based on user input.
Server-Side Processing:

Built using Bun.js for efficient server-side operations.
Seamlessly integrates with PostgreSQL for robust data management.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Clone the project repository from GitHub and navigate into the project directory.
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Bun installed. Install the required dependencies using Bun.
Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory. Add PostgreSQL and OpenAI API credentials to this file.
Usage
Start the Bun.js Server:

Start the server using Bun. This will initiate the backend server to handle requests.
Endpoints:

POST /generate:
This endpoint generates investment suggestions based on user input and database data.
The request body should include user input detailing specific requirements for the investment suggestions.
Detailed Code Explanation
Core Data Handling
Environment Setup:
Environment variables are managed using dotenv to securely handle credentials and configuration settings.
Database Connection:
The database connection is established using PostgreSQL client credentials sourced from environment variables.
A function is used to connect to the PostgreSQL database, logging a success message upon connection.
Fetching Data:
A function is provided to fetch data from the PostgreSQL database. It executes a SQL query to retrieve data from the properties table, limited to a specified number of rows.
The fetched data is logged and returned as an array of rows.
Closing Connection:
A function is available to close the connection to the PostgreSQL database, logging a success message upon disconnection.
Server Setup and Request Handling
Initialization:
The server is initialized using Bun's built-in server capabilities.
Environment variables are loaded, and the OpenAI client is initialized with the API key from the environment variables.
Data Summarization:
A function is used to summarize property data by extracting key attributes such as listing ID, city, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The summarized data is logged.
Prompt Construction:
A function constructs a prompt for the OpenAI API based on user input and the summarized data. This prompt is formatted to provide context to the AI for generating investment suggestions.
AI Suggestion Generation:
A function sends the constructed prompt to the OpenAI API and retrieves suggestions. It handles the response and logs the AI's suggestions.
Request Handling:
A function processes incoming requests to generate suggestions. It retrieves user input, fetches data from the database, constructs the prompt, generates suggestions using the OpenAI API, and streams the response back to the client.
Server Operation:
The server listens on a specified port and handles POST requests to the /generate endpoint by invoking the request handling function.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up and run the LagunaAI project, leveraging Bun.js, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI to provide AI-powered real estate investment suggestions. The detailed setup ensures efficient server-side processing and robust data management, making it a powerful tool for analyzing real estate data and making data-driven investment decisions.
