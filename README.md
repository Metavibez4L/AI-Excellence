🌟 AI-Powered Real Estate Analysis Platform
📋 Overview
This AI-powered real estate analysis platform leverages Bun.js, PostgreSQL databases, Hono for middleware, and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to deliver comprehensive insights and suggestions. The platform is designed to demonstrate the potential of advanced technologies for future adoption by companies.

🚀 Features
Multi-Database Integration: Connects to multiple PostgreSQL databases, aggregating data for comprehensive analysis.
Data Summarization: Processes and summarizes complex real estate data into concise, actionable insights.
User Query Handling: Accepts user queries related to real estate, integrates them with database data, and constructs prompts for analysis.
AI-Powered Analysis: Uses GPT-4 to generate sophisticated insights and strategies based on summarized data and user input.
Streaming Responses: Streams AI-generated responses back to the user efficiently, providing quick, interactive feedback.
Robust Error Handling: Ensures system reliability and ease of troubleshooting.
🔍 How It Works
🧠 AI Insight Generation
User Input: The user submits a query related to real estate data.
Data Retrieval: The system connects to multiple PostgreSQL databases and fetches relevant real estate data based on the user's query.
Data Summarization: The retrieved data is processed and summarized to create a clear and concise dataset that highlights key information.
Prompt Construction: A prompt is constructed by combining the summarized data with the user's query, providing context and specific details to the AI model.
AI Analysis: The constructed prompt is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The AI uses its vast knowledge base and advanced natural language processing capabilities to analyze the prompt.
Generating Insights: Based on the analysis, the AI generates sophisticated strategies, data summaries, and other actionable insights tailored to the user's query and the summarized data.
Streaming Responses: The generated insights are streamed back to the user in a quick and responsive manner, allowing for an interactive and efficient feedback loop.
